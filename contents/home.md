#### Education

B.S., Biological Science, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), 2022—2023.\
B.E., Computer Science and Technology, USTC, 2023—2027 (expected).\
B.S., Biological Science (minor), USTC, 2023—2027 (expected).

#### Research Interests

I am interested in the intersection of computer science and biology, particularly, in the fields of bioinformatics, computational biology. Currently, I am working on the application of  machine learning and deep learning in biological data analysis, such as the prediction of protein-protein interactions (e.g. antigen-antibody interactions) and the processing of biological or medical images (e.g. cell segmentation).

Now I am a member of the [QuLab](https://qulab.ustc.edu.cn/) in USTC, led by Prof. [Kun Qu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2CdOi4EAAAAJ).
