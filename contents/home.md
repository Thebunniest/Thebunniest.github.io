#### About Me

I am an undergraduate student at the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) (USTC) pursuing a B.E. in 💻**Computer Science and Technology** with a minor in 🧬**Biological Science**, and a member of Hua Xia Talent Program in Computer Science and Technology at USTC.

#### Education

B.S., Biological Science, USTC, 2022—2023.\
B.E., Computer Science and Technology, USTC, 2023—2027 (expected).\
B.S., Biological Science (minor), USTC, 2023—2027 (expected).

#### Research Interests

My research interests lie in the intersection of computer science and biology, particularly in the fields of bioinformatics and computational biology.

Currently, I am working on the application of technologies like machine learning and deep learning in biological data analysis, such as the prediction of antigen-antibody interactions (led by Prof. [Fuli Feng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QePM4u8AAAAJ)), and the processing of biological or medical images (cell segmentation, led by Prof. [Kun Qu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2CdOi4EAAAAJ)).
