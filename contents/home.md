#### Research Interests

My research interests lie in the intersection of computer science and biology, particularly in the fields of bioinformatics and computational biology.
Currently, I am working on the application of machine learning and deep learning in biological data analysis, such as the prediction of antigen-antibody interactions(led by Prof. [Fuli Feng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QePM4u8AAAAJ)) and the processing of biological or medical images (cell segmentation, led by Prof. [Kun Qu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2CdOi4EAAAAJ)).
